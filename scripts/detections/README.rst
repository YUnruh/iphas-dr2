detections.py
=============

Generates user-friendly single-band IPHAS detection catalogues.

This script reads in catalogues produces by the 'imcore' image detection tool
of the Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit (CASU) pipeline, and transforms
these catalogues into a more user-friendly format used in the data release.
