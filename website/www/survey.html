    <h3>Survey duration</h3>

    <p>Observing began in semester 2003B. By the end of 2008, every survey field had been observed at least once. The survey will be formally complete once it is confirmed that acceptable data quality has been achieved in all fields.</p>
    
    <h3>Survey area and resolution</h3> 
    <p>This is all Galactic
    longitudes in the Northern Plane within the latitude range -5&deg;
    &lt; b &lt; 5&deg;, a total of 1800 square degrees. The INT Wide
    Field Camera (WFC) offers a pixel scale of 0.33 arcsec per pix,
    allowing on-sky structures above 1 arcsec in size to be resolved
    in principle.</p>

    <h3>Survey filters and observing strategy</h3> 
    <p>At each pointing,
    sequences of narrow-band H&alpha;, Sloan r' and i' images are
    obtained with the INT's Wide Field Camera. The H&alpha; filter has
    a bandwidth of 95 &Aring; and is centred at 6568 &Aring;. For the
    accompanying broad-band filters we have preferred the Sloan
    filters because of the more nearly rectangular shape of their
    pass-bands. The aim is to cover the survey footprint twice,
    observing once at each of a set of specified field centres that
    combine to cover the plane once, and then again at a second set of
    offset positions. This strategy enhances our quality control and
    ensures that strips of sky, otherwise falling in the gaps between
    CCDs, are not left out altogether. The total number of field
    centres demanded by this strategy works out at 7635 x 2.  The
    telescope time needed to take data at each field position (plus
    its offset) and move to the next field centre is approximately 10 
    minutes.</p>

    <h3>Magnitude limits</h3> 
    <p>The faint-end limiting broadband
    magnitude deemed acceptable for release is r=20 or better
      (5&sigma;). In most data, it is rather better than this (r =
    21-22).  H&alpha; filter exposure
    times were fixed at 120 secs throughout as a compromise between 
    approaching the broad-band magnitude limit (it is typically a
    magnitude brighter), and ensuring the total survey execution time
    was feasible. The narrowband sensitivity is similar to that of the 
    AAO UKST H&amp;alpha survey.  The i band faint limit is also
    typically about a magnitude brighter than in r.  Since most
    fainter Galactic Plane objects have typical r-i of ~1, the number
    counts in r band and i band are not very different.  In median seeing, saturation is
    around 13th magnitude.</p>  

  <h3>Image background</h3> 
    <p>Much of the data-taking was performed in 
    bright time, except when the bright moon falls in the Galactic
    Plane (times at which grey/dark time was essential). For those
    fields observed near times of full moon, this has resulted in
    considerable variation of background levels in the images over and
    above that due to diffuse H&alpha;, which need to be addressed
    before the data can be mosaicked successfully.</p> 

  <h3>Seeing and photometric reliability</h3> 
    <p>The target seeing
    limit for data to be counted as meeting survey requirements is 2
    arcsec. Some data at worse seeing in lower density fields when the
    sky transparency was nevertheless good will be released.  Median
    seeing in survey-standard data is 1.1 arcsec.  Standard star
    observations are typically obtained every 2-3 hours to facilitate 
    photometric calibration of the survey data.  The external, or
    systematic, errors are expected to be in the region of 0.03
    magnitudes. We calibrate in the Vega system (not AB).</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>All imaging data obtained via this programme can be accessed from CASU by any interested researchers working in UK, Spanish or Dutch centres.</p>
    <p>From December 2007, source catalogues as well as images from observations obtained prior to January 2006 have been made available via the <a href="http://idr.iphas.org/">Initial Data Release</a>.</p>
