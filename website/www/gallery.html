    <h1>IPHAS Image Gallery</h1>
  </div>

    <p>Here are some mosaicked images that have been constructed from IPHAS data so far.</p>
    <p>(Please note: The images in this gallery are released into the public domain. If any image or images are redisplayed or reproduced, please accompany the image or images with the following acknowledgment: "Image based on data obtained as part of the INT Photometric H&alpha; Survey of the Northern Galactic Plane: prepared by [name of image author/s as given below], [institutional affiliation of image author/s]")</p><img class="centred"  alt="bipolar planetary nebula discovered in IPHAS data" src="http://www.iphas.org/images/iphas6pn.jpg" />
    <p>This beautiful nebula is a composite built from follow-up narrow band imaging of this IPHAS discovery. The equatorial ring, broken up into head-tail cometary structures was picked up first in H&alpha; in IPHAS exposures. The more diffuse structure bathing the central equatorial ring is seen in [OIII], while the detached polar knots ('ansae', shown in blue) were detected in [NII]. From ansa to ansa, the aky angle is a few arcminutes. (credits: Nick Wright; the additional narrowband data was collected by Romano Corradi and collaborators)</p>
    <p><img class="centred" src="http://www.iphas.org/images/pn_iphas.jpg"  alt="false-colour IPHAS image" /></p>
    <p>This is another IPHAS discovery - The Prince's Nebula. It was the first planetary nebula noticed in IPHAS data not long after the start of the survey in 2003, and it has become the subject of published paper (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006A%26A...458..203M">Mampaso et al 2006</a>). This is on account of its unusual morphology and its location, toward the outer edge of the disk of the Milky Way. This H&alpha; image shows just the bright waist of a much larger fainter nebula whose main axis lies roughly at right angles to this waist. It is nicknamed "The Prince's Nebula" for it becoming a virtual wedding present to the Prince of Spain, an astronomy enthusiast, on the occasion of his wedding in 2004.</p><img class="centred"  alt="WR nebula NGC 6888" src="http://www.iphas.org/images/ngc6888.jpg" />
    <p>This is NGC 6888, otherwise known as the Crescent Nebula. It is the illuminated ejecta of the WR star, HD192163. This image combines data from all three IPHAS survey passbands (H&alpha;, Sloan r' and i') in a false colour composite. Emission in the H&alpha; narrow band is in red, of course. The orientation is with N to the left and E down, and the image scale is about 20 x 18 square arcminutes (credits: Jonathan Irwin)</p><img class="centred"  alt="SNR S147" src="http://www.iphas.org/images/s147_test4.jpg" />
    <p>This is a continuum subtracted H&alpha; image of the supernova
    remnant S147, located on the sky toward the anti-galactic
    centre. A strength of IPHAS is that it offers the chance to
    construct images of parts of the Galactic Plane on any scale from
    arcseconds up to degrees. This is a very large-scale image, built
    up by mosaicking a large number of overlapping IPHAS fields
    together: the total imaged area is roughly 5 x 3.5 square
    degrees. The bright blob to the left of the picture is a more
    typically compact Galactic nebula. (credits: Albert Zijlstra, and Jonathan Irwin)</p><img class="centred"  alt="HII region IC1396B" src="http://www.iphas.org/images/ic1396.jpg" />
    <p>This is a false-colour composite of nebulosity in the vicinity of the HII region, IC 1396B, in Cepheus. The image scale here is roughly 15 x 15 square arcminutes, with N to the left and E down. (credit: Nick Wright)</p><img class="centred"  alt="A dust lane in the Rosette Nebula" src="http://www.iphas.org/images/rosette_dustlane.jpg" />
    <p>This is an excerpt from Nick Wright's mosaic of the entire Rosette Nebula, built as the IC 1396B image. The centre of this HII region, where the exciting star cluster (NGC 2244) is located, lies at the middle-bottom of this image (N is to the left, and E down). The longer dimension in this image is approximately 30 arcminutes. (credit: Nick Wright)</p>
    <p>Some more image mosaics derived from IPHAS observations can be found on <a href="http://iapetus.phy.umist.ac.uk/IPHAS/iphas.html">Albert Zijlstra's web page</a>, and also on <a href="https://www.star.herts.ac.uk/~nwright/imaging.html">Nick Wright's IPHAS gallery</a>.</p>
