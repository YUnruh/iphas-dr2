====================
IPHAS Data Release 2
====================

Python package and scripts used to produce the IPHAS Data Release 2 (DR2) source catalogue.

:authors: Geert Barentsen; Hywel Farnhill
:dependencies: astropy (0.2.3), numpy, scipy, IPython.

Contents
--------
- **dr2**: Python package consisting of the following modules:

  + **detections.py**: converts the detection catalogues generated by the CASU pipeline into tables with user-friendly column names (following UKIDSS conventions), magnitudes and error flags.
  + **bandmerging.py**: merges the H-alpha/r/i detections for same pointings in the same night.
  + **offsets.py**: computes the photometric shifts between exposure overlaps.
  + **calibration.py**: computes a global photometric calibration from the offsets.
  + **seaming.py**: identifies multiple detections of the same source, and assigns the best ('primary') detection.
  + **concatenating.py**: concatenates the output of the seaming algorithm into the final source catalogue.
- **scripts**: various helper scripts.
- **website**: redesigned website to be launched with DR2.

Workflow
--------
The script **pipeline.py** in the root directory contains all the commands necessary to produce the IPHAS DR2 source catalogue.
