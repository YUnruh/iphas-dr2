Known issues
============

This is a list of known issues in the IPHAS data to watch out for when generating catalogues from the pipeline-produced detection lists.

 * In ubercrowded fields, the WCS astrometric fit can be off by more than 0.5 arcsec towards the edges of a CCD. The problem is rare and has been resolved ad-hoc using the code under scripts/tune-wcs.
 * The WCS keywords in the pipeline catalogues can be inconsistent at times. For a generic fix, see "fix_wcs()" in the iphasDetection.py script.
 * Spurious sources frequently appear in the vignetted corners of CCD's 3 & 1. These need to be masked out.
 * dec2003 runs show bad columns in CCD #3 (x=1244-1245) and CCD #4 (x=549) which are not masked out by the confidence map. This caused a significant numbers of spurious sources around those columns. These sources are currently flagges as having bad pixels by the detections.py script.
 * The 'badpix' information is missing from the pipeline-produced catalogues in the first few months of the survey.
