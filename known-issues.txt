Known issues
============

This is a list of known issues in the pipeline-reduced IPHAS data received from Cambridge, which were encountered during the generation of DR2. Some of the issues have only been fixed on an ad-hoc basis and should be reviewed for DR3.

 * In very crowded fields, the WCS astrometric fit can be off by more than 0.5 arcsec towards the edges of a CCD. The problem is rare and has been resolved ad-hoc using the code under scripts/tune-wcs (which details the runs that have been fixed.) However, for DR3 it might be worth refining the astrometry on a systematic basis.
 * The WCS keywords in the pipeline catalogues are inconsistent at times. For the time being the keywords have been fixed in the "fix_wcs()" function in the dr2.detection module.
 * Spurious sources frequently appear in the vignetted corners of CCD's 3 & 1. These had to be masked out.
 * dec2003 runs show bad columns in CCD #3 (x=1244-1245) and CCD #4 (x=549) which are not masked out by the confidence map. This caused a significant numbers of spurious sources around those columns. These sources are currently flagges as having bad pixels by the detections.py script.
 * The 'badpix' information is missing from the pipeline-produced catalogues in the first few months of the survey (i.e. 2003.)
 * The bandmerging script relies on the Stilts "tmatchn multimode=group" feature, which however does not guarantee delivering the best match in very crowded fields. (cf. http://www.star.bristol.ac.uk/~mbt/stilts/sun256/matchGroup.html)
* A very small number of fields lack a few header keywords normally necessary for computing magnitudes (i.e. EXTINCT, APCOR, PERCORR). For DR2 default values were assumed when needed.


 Lessons learnt
 ==============
 * Detections near the edges and corners of CCDs must be avoided - this is where spurious detections often appear.
 * Be aware that the MAGZPT keywords in the FITS headers are not corrected for extinction, apcor, or percorr.
